All JSON objects being send between python have the following structure:
{"tag": TAG, "data": DATA}
TAG is a string signaling generally what data the packet contains so that the program can send it to the correct location.
DATA is some arbitrary data that usually specifies what should be done and if needed contains parameters for that action, 
or contains some requested data.

Used tags:
"envision request":
    Tag used for requesting actions of the ENVISIoN class.
    Data is a list, where first element is a string signaling what action should be taken.
    Second element is arbitrary data depending on action, set to null if none needed.

    Envision general Request data packages:
        Request data is structured in the following way:
        [REQUEST_TYPE, DATA]
        REQIEST_TYPE is a string signaling what the request wants done.
        DATA is arbitrary data specific to the REQUEST_TYPE.

    Envision general Response data:
        Response data is structured in the following way
        [REQUEST_TYPE, SUCCESS, DATA]
        REQUEST_TYPE is the same string as the type in the request.
        SUCCESS is a boolean signaling if request was fulfilled sucessfully.
        DATA is abitrary relating to the request. 

    Specific Request and Response pairs used.

        Request data -> Response data

        ["start vis", VIS_TYPE] -> ["start vis", SUCCESS, VIS_TYPE, INFO]
        VIS_TYPE is string of visualization to be started
        INFO is a string about what happened. Can for example be reason for failing to meet the request.

        ["stop vis", VIS_TYPE] -> ["stop vis", true/false, VIS_TYPE, INFO]
        VIS_TYPE is string of visualization to be started
        true/false in response depends on if request was fulfilled correctly
        INFO is a string about what happened. Can for example be reason for failing to meet the request.

        ["edit", [VIS_TYPE, EDIT_TYPE, EDIT_DATA]] -> ["edit", SUCCESS, INFO]
        ["data request", [VIS_TYPE, WHAT]] -> ["data request", SUCCESS, DATA]


"response": 
    Tag used for packages send back as response to a requested action. 
    Data is a list with two elements, 
    where the first element is a string identifying the requested action. 
    Second element in list is a boolean, true if action was successful and false if failed.
    Third element in list is arbitrary data based on the action, set to null if not needed.

"echo":
    Tag used to signify sending back the same data which was recieved.
    Data is the exact message which was recieved.

    Example:
    {"tag": "echo", "data": {"tag": "envision request", "data": ["start charge", null]}}
