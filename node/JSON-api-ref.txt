All JSON objects being send between python have the following structure:
{"tag": TAG, "data": DATA}
TAG is a string signaling generally what data the packet contains so that the program can send it to the correct location.
DATA is some arbitrary data that usually specifies what should be done and if needed contains parameters for that action, 
or contains some requested data.

Used tags:
"envision request":
    Tag used for requesting actions of the ENVISIoN class.
    Data is a list, where first element is a string signaling what action should be taken.
    Second element is arbitrary data depending on action, set to null if none needed.

    Examples:
    {"tag": "envision request", "data": ["start charge", null]}
    {"tag": "envision request", "data": ["stop vis", null]}

"response": 
    Tag used for packages send back as response to a requested action. 
    Data is a list with two elements, 
    where the first element is a string identifying the requested action. 
    Second element in list is a boolean, true if action was successful and false if failed.
    Third element in list is arbitrary data based on the action, set to null if not needed.

"echo":
    Tag used to signify sending back the same data which was recieved.
    Data is the exact message which was recieved.

    Example:
    {"tag": "echo", "data": {"tag": "envision request", "data": ["start charge", null]}}
