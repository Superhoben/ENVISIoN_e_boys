\section{Start ENVISIoN or Inviwo}
\label{sec: start envision}
\subsection{Start ENVISIoN}
When the building for Inviwo with ENVISIoN is finished, we can start the application's graphical user interface. If you have structured the file system as explained in section 2 and section 3, the start up of the application should be the same on every operating system. Open up a terminal or command window and execute the following command in the terminal:

\begin{lstlisting}[frame = single, breaklines = true]
    python3 ~/ENVISIoN/ENVISIoN/envisionGUI/GUI.py
\end{lstlisting}

The application ENVISIoN should start and the GUI will pop up. For further instruction concering ENVISIoN's GUI, see section \ref{sec:newGUI}.

\subsection{Start Inviwo}
During the development of ENVISIoN it can be an advantage to use only Inviwo and its graphical user interface. If the installation of ENVISIoN with Inviwo is made correctly, open a terminal or command window and navigate to the ENVISIoN directory: 

\begin{lstlisting}[frame = single, breaklines = true]
    cd ~ENVISIoN/ENVISIoN
\end{lstlisting}

Then, type in the following command in the terminal to start Inviwo:

\begin{lstlisting}[frame = single, breaklines = true]
    inviwo-build/bin/inviwo
\end{lstlisting}
